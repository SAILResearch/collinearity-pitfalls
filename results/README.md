# Experimental Results

**Correlation Analysis** - Results of correlation analysis for each of the studied datasets.

**Mitigated Metrics** - These metrics are selected using (1) the variable clustering analysis (VarClus) with the Spearman correlation threshold value of 0.7 and (2) the variance inflation factor analysis (VIF) with the threshold value of 5 for each of the publicly-available defect datasets.
